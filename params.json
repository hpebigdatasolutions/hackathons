For Admin user, it \r\ncan provide a better analysis and visualization in CAF Storage Service. Also, for Customer user, it gives a simple and convenience way to utilize CAF Storage Service.\r\nAs the expectation for \"CAF file system\", we plan to provide:\r\n* A series of Dashboards with various KPIs visualization to CAF Storage Service\r\n* Integrate \"CAF file system\" into Linux with FUSE.\r\n* Command Line Interface, which is similar with \"Hadoop File System CLI\"\r\n* \"File System\" Java APIs based on CAF Storage APIs\r\n\r\n__Video__: TBD \r\n\r\n### Best GUI - Completeness, clarity, simplicity, aesthetic value \r\n\r\n__Video__: TBD \r\n\r\n### Most innovative use of CAF APIs \r\n\r\n__Description__: Objective of the project:\r\n* Gather digital media sources about an event or an organization or a brand.\r\n* Store the media on cloud using CAF storage.\r\n* Process the media and develop a usable abstract to analyze the big data, use entity extraction, stemming, etc.\r\n* Search big datasets on social media, blogs, news feeds, search engines, etc. using the abstract.\r\n* Develop useful insights about that specific event or brand. Come up with statistical/data models.\r\n* Render the models in graphs visually for ease of use\r\n* Make the complex data simpler!\r\n\r\n__CAF Components Used__: Storage, IDM, Policy Workflow, Speech-to-text, Elements \r\n\r\n__Other Components Used__: HAVEn on Demand, Google Trends API, New York Times feed, Twitter APIs \r\n\r\n__Data Sources Used__: Twitter feed, Event press releases, Presidential debate transcripts \r\n\r\n__Video__: TBD \r\n\r\n### Most interesting / fun app \r\n\r\n__Video__: TBD \r\n\r\n### Honorable Mention \r\n\r\n__Description__: Our project is called Cloud Storage Multiplier(CSM). This is an adapter application that works for cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive. It utilizes CAF Storage Service’s block-level deduplication feature to help the users significantly increase their data transmission speed and largely save the online space. Small business companies will benefit from this application most because we can help to reduce a large amount of duplicate data across the whole company. At the same time, CSM exponentially increases the company’s file sharing capability because the shared file stub is only ~KB instead of ~MB or even ~GB. In one word, the combined space of duplicate data and shared files, and the time of transmitting duplicate data are what CSM can save for the users. \r\n\r\n__CAF Components Used__: CAF Storage and CAF IDM services \r\n\r\n__Other Components Used__: N/A \r\n\r\n__Data Sources Used__: Dropbox \r\n\r\n__Video__: TBD \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
