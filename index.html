<p>The Southborough Hackathon took place in March 2016. The teams were tasked with building unique applications from the IM&amp;G Common Application Framework (CAF) 
components.  </p>

<p>Besides the CAF components, Hackathon teams took advantage of IDOL, HPE Elements, web data, and a host of other resources available 
to build applications within a 24 hour window.  </p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Our app, named “CAF file system”, is a remote virtual file system based on CAF Storage Service.</p>

<p><strong>CAF Components Used</strong>: CAF Storage Service</p>

<p><strong>Other Components Used</strong>: FUSE (File System in user space)</p>

<p><strong>Data Source</strong>: none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: This app is designed to implement a "File System" style APIs on top of existing CAF Storage APIs. For an Admin user, it 
provides an improved analysis and visualization of the data stored by CAF Storage Service. Also, for a Customer user, it provides a simple and convenient way to utilize 
the CAF Storage Service.
The overall goals of the project were:</p>

<ul>
<li>A series of Dashboards with various KPIs visualizations of CAF Storage Service data</li>
<li>Integration of "CAF file system" into Linux with FUSE.</li>
<li>Command Line Interface, similar to Hadoop File System CLI</li>
<li>"File System" Java APIs based on CAF Storage APIs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The goal of this project was to combine a search engine with the CAF Policy engine in order to create a powerful and highly 
configurable search.  The application is powerful because it can work with billions of search results.  It is highly configurable because it ties into the CAF Policy 
engine and can also be used with different search providers like Google, IDOL, or Bing.  For the demo, HPE Elements is used to display the search results and create 
graphs that describe what policies are matched by the query results.</p>

<p><strong>CAF Components Used</strong>: CAF Policy Engine, HPE Elements</p>

<p><strong>Other Components Used</strong>: Tomcat, Java</p> 

<p><strong>Data Sources Used</strong>: Google search</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Objective of the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather digital media sources about an event or an organization or a brand.</li>
<li>Store the media on cloud using CAF storage.</li>
<li>Process the media and develop a usable abstract to analyze the big data, use entity extraction, stemming, etc.</li>
<li>Search big datasets on social media, blogs, news feeds, search engines, etc. using the abstract.</li>
<li>Develop useful insights about that specific event or brand. Come up with statistical/data models.</li>
<li>Render the models in graphs visually for ease of use</li>
<li>Make the complex data simpler!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CAF Components Used</strong>: Storage, IDM, Policy Workflow, Speech-to-text, Elements </p>

<p><strong>Other Components Used</strong>: HAVEn on Demand, Google Trends API, New York Times feed, Twitter APIs </p>

<p><strong>Data Sources Used</strong>: Twitter feed, Event press releases, Presidential debate transcripts </p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Our goal was to write software that could leverage CAF services to analyze a video for usable words, pick those words out, and 
rearrange them into new audio clips. Originally, we wanted these videos to be analyzed dynamically, and include a variety of different voices. Early on in development 
we realized this was impractical, so we reduced scope to a single voice (Hillary Clinton), with the videos analyzed ahead of time, but still dynamically re-combined 
from the prepared words. We expected the results to be hilarious, and they were.
</p>

<p><strong>CAF Components Used</strong>: CAF Storage, CAF Policy, Speech Worker </p>

<p><strong>Other Components Used</strong>: Java Audio Library </p>

<p><strong>Data Sources Used</strong>: Hillary Clinton campaign speech videos, found

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Our project is called Cloud Storage Multiplier(CSM). This is an adapter application that works for cloud storage services such as 
Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive. It utilizes CAF Storage Service’s block-level deduplication feature to help the users significantly increase their data transmission 
speed and largely save the online space. Small business companies will benefit from this application most because we can help to reduce a large amount of duplicate data 
across the whole company. At the same time, CSM exponentially increases the company’s file sharing capability because the shared file stub is only ~KB instead of ~MB or 
even ~GB. In summary, the combined space of duplicate data and shared files, and the time of transmitting duplicate data are what CSM can save for the users. </p>

<p><strong>CAF Components Used</strong>: CAF Storage and CAF IDM services </p>

<p><strong>Other Components Used</strong>: N/A </p>

<p><strong>Data Sources Used</strong>: Dropbox </p>
